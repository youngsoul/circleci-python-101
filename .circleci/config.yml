orbs:
  # The python orb contains a set of prepackaged circleci configuration you can use repeatedly in your configurations files
  # Orb commands and jobs help you with common scripting around a language/tool
  # so you dont have to copy and paste it everywhere.
  # See the orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/python
  python: circleci/python@2.1.1

    # These next lines defines a docker executors: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/
    # You can specify an image from dockerhub or use one of the convenience images from CircleCI's Developer Hub
    # A list of available CircleCI docker convenience images are available here: https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/python

    # Checkout the code as the first step. This is a dedicated CircleCI step.
    # The python orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a Pipfile via Pipenv by default.
    # Here we're making sure we use just use the system-wide pip. By default it uses the project root's requirements.txt.
    # Then run your tests!
    # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
